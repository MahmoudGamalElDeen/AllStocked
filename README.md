# AllStocked

All Stocked is a solution to inventory management. Developed to make managing inventories easier, 
this web application has a shopping list feature that is very helpful to the business users.

All Stocked has user registration and login. When logged in users can start adding products to their 
inventory. There are properties for each product that help with this including category, supply(current quantity),
Par(optimal quantity), demand(quatity flag to buy), and product description.

All Stocked is mobile friendly, making viewing the users shopping list easy to view and update while
shopping. A really nice feature is the shopping list which is calculated. When an employee notices an 
items supply is low, said employee, can log into companies AllStocked account update the product items
supply and if the supply is equal to or less than products Par, this item will then be added to the 
shopping cart. Managing inventory items this way eases the duties off of one person, making management less 
burdensome. 

When ordering/shopping for supplies in some industries is quite frequent(exp. coffee shop) the inventory 
manager has a nice updated list of low inventory items. When bought there is corresonding remove button that 
removes item from shopping list by setting items supply to par with just the click of a button.
