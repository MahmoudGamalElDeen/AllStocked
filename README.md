All Stocked is a solution to inventory management. Developed to make managing inventories easier, 
this web application has a shopping list feature that is very helpful to the business users.

All Stocked has user registration and login. When logged in users can start adding products to their 
inventory. There are properties for each product that help with this including category, supply(current quantity),
Par(optimal quantity), demand(quatity flag to buy), and product description.
